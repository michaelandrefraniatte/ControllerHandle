Connect joycon right, and the joycon left, with bluetooth, normally joycon right is number zero and joycon left is number one
Another program can support both joycons from Nintendo, connected together in charging grip, with a usb-c cable to usb-a, to your PC, but I tried without success
Only official joycons from Nintendo are running with this method, not joycons from Freaks and Geeks
